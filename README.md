# Git-Identities
**User identity management for git**

This program is meant to be used by people who work on multiple projects
with different Git identities, e.g. students or home-office workers.

Git-Identities allows you to change your Git config's `user.name` and `user.email`
easily and quickly from a database of known identities,
and provides automatic setters and checks to assure you're never committing with the wrong config again.

**This requires Git version `2.10+` to work correctly.**

## Usage

### Basics

Every command in this program has a help function by calling it with `-h` or `--help`.

The main command is `git identities`.
It allows managing your identities and applying it to different contexts.

With `git identities list`, you can list all known identities.

With `git identities add <id> <name> <email>`, you can add a new identity.
As `<id>`, use an identifier that can be used to reference your identity later,
it has to be alphanumeric with underscores, not starting with a number.

With `git identities apply <id>`, the identity is set as the local config's `user.name` and `user.email`.
You can reset a local choice with `git identities use-global`.

### "current context"

By "current context", the program means the configuration as it would be used by Git in the current directory.
This is either the local config in `.git/config` or a submodule config directory, that has overriden other settings,
the global config, or the system-wide config, whatever comes first in this order.

### Verifying

The main purpose of the Git-Identities program is to ensure that you're using the right identity.

To accomplish this, you can use
```bash
git identities update <id> --paths /path/to/projects1 /path/to/projects2 ...
```

to set one or more paths, whose subdirectories will honor the given identity.
If the program is installed correctly,
it will not let you commit
if you would commit with a different identity than the one that should be used in the current context.

(You can override this for one time by calling `git commit --no-verify`, if you need to.)

It will also warn you (but not stop you to commit)
if the current context does not match to any identity known to Git-Identities.

#### Keywords

Git-Identities also supports keywords.
They can be set with
```bash
git identities update <id> --keywords keyword1 keyword2 ...
```

An identity with a keyword matches whenever the path contains the keyword, anywhere.
Paths are always prioritized, and keywords are prioritized by the order they were specified in the `update` command.

Paths are recommended and keywords discouraged, as they can prove a bit unpredictable.
They have their advantages for verifying, though, sometimes.

#### Example

Assume we have used
```bash
git identities add private "Woalk" "woalk@example.com"
git identities add work "Name Surname" "surname@example.com"
```
to add two identities.

Assume further that we have a directory structure of
`/home/woalk/git` for private projects,
with a subdirectory `work` for work projects.

So, we use
```bash
git identities update private --paths /home/woalk/git
git identities update work --paths /home/woalk/git/work
```
to set up our identity checks.

If we now want to commit something in our project
`/home/woalk/git/privateproject1`,
Git-Identities will ensure it is done with the `private` identity,
which means using `Woalk` as `user.name` and `woalk@example.com` as `user.email`.

If we now want to commit something in our project
`/home/woalk/git/work/topsecretproject1`,
Git-Identities will ensure it is done with the `work` identity,
which means using `Name Surname` as `user.name` and `surname@example.com` as `user.email`.

### Auto-applying

Git-Identities can automatically set the correct config from the settings.

This can either be done manually, by calling
```bash
git identities apply --auto
``` 
in the respective repository, or by calling
```bash
git id-clone <url> ...
```
instead of `git clone` when cloning a repository.
It will check the destination directory for the applying identity
and set it via directly when cloning.

It supports every argument that `git clone` supports, except `[<directory>]`.
See `man git clone` for details.

## Installation

### Script

Use the `install.sh` script from this directory.

It is a careful script that will tell you everything it will do
and provide you with a chance to review the changes before committing them.

After installation, Git-Identities is available via `git identities`,
assuming the main binary installation place chosen in the installation script was in your `PATH`.

### Installation place

It will ask you to move the checked-out repo into a system-wide directory before running the script.

On Linux systems, you can use, for example, `/opt`.
On macOS systems, you can use `/usr/local`, or `/usr/local/opt` if you have `brew` installed.

On Linux, you should `chown` the repo to `root:root` for security reasons.
On macOS, you can `chown` it to `root:wheel`, assuming you're ok with that if you have `brew` installed.

### Optional configuration

You can create additional Git alias commands for better access to Git-Identities, e.g.
```bash
git config alias.id identities
git config alias.ic id-clone
```
to access the commands via `git id` and `git ic`.

If you build something better with it, I would love to know and get a PR, but it isn't mandatory.
